reviewers_JBI_LoadData.R - as it suggests loads in the tsv. files and creates the R data structures.
reviewers_JBI_DrugList.R - performs (so far) the majority of the processing to generate the candidates drugs for repurposing.

reviewersJBIloadData.RData - avoids the need to run reviewers_JBI_LoadData.R  everytime.
