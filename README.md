# DrugSideEffects
Drugs with similar side-effects are potential candidates for use elsewhere, the supposition is that similar side-effects may be caused by drugs targeting similar proteins. 
DrugBank and SIDER4 are publicly-available resources of drug information and side-effects. It is our intention to repurpose drugs using these resources for various diseases.
The objective of drug repositioning is to apply existing drugs to different diseases or medical conditions than the original target, and thus alleviate to a certain extent the time and cost expended in drug development. The area of drug repositioning is a suitable application area for computational intelligence because numerous online databases containing technical information on drug targets, protein interactions, side-effects and biological knowledge are currently available. 

This work augments and takes further the issues discussed in 
# This is work in progress and the R files will definately change over the next few weeks.
