## DrugSideEffects
Drugs with similar side-effects are potential candidates for use elsewhere, the supposition is that similar side-effects may be caused by drugs targeting similar proteins. [DrugBank](http://www.drugbank.ca/ "Drugbank Homepage: Resource") and [SIDER4](http://sideeffects.embl.de/ "SIDER Homepage: Side Effect Resource")  are publicly-available resources of drug information and side-effects. It is our intention to repurpose drugs using these resources for various diseases. 

The objective of  `drug repositioning` is to apply existing drugs to different diseases or medical conditions than the original target, and thus alleviate to a certain extent the time and cost expended in drug development. The area of drug repositioning is a suitable application area for `computational intelligence` because numerous online databases containing technical information on drug targets, protein interactions, side-effects and biological knowledge are currently available. 

Whilst no guarentees can be made as to the eventual repostioning success of any candidate drug generated by the computational techniques, it is a good first step in reducing the search space for potential drugs.

This work augments and takes further the issues we discussed in our [UKCI-2015](https://github.com/kenmcgarry/UKCI2015-side-effects/blob/master/UKCI2015_McGarry.pdf) paper.
